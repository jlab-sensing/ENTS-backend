# Client/Frontend Documentation

## Introduction

The ENTS client is built with [React](https://react.dev/), a compoenent based web library and [MUI](https://mui.com/) as the UI component library.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run test`

Starts the vitest

### `npm run test:ui`

Starts the vitest with interactive UI

### `npm run coverage`

Runs a coverage test with vitest using --coverage flag

### `npm run lint`

Runs lint

### `npm run lint:fix`

Runs lint and fixes fixable lint errors

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


## Testing

### Intro

For testing, it uses [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as the testing framework, [msv](https://mswjs.io/) as the API mocking library, and [testing library's](https://testing-library.com/) testing utilities.

### Stucture

Testing files are denoted in these formats `*.test.js` or `*.test.jsx` depending on type of tests. Tests are stored with their compoennts, under a `__tests__` for multiple tests or an individual file. For integration tests, they should be store with the highest level and relevant component. End to end testing have not been implemnted to due changing scope of the backend.

## Linting

Files are to be linted under the [eslint config](.eslintrc.json).

To lint run

```console
npm run lint
```

## Formatting

Files are to be formatted uner the [prettier config](.prettierrc.json).

To format, for vscode, install the extentiona nd follow the guide. For other ides, setup prettier using their [docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install)

## Docker Builds

The ENTS client has two docker targets, `development` and `production`. The developent target runs `npm start` and hot reload is supported in `docker-compose.yml` with volumes. The production target builds the client using `npm build` and servers static files using [nginx](https://www.f5.com/products/nginx)

## HTTP Requests

The ENTS client uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) as it's http client. There are two main instances of Axios used, one that handles authenticated requests and the other that handles all other requests. See [auth](#auth)

## Charts

The charts generated by ENTS client are bootstrapped using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [react-chartjs-2](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2). At the time of writing this, react-chartjs-2 may potientially be losing support, hence an alternative may need to replace this in the future

## Auth

The authentication context is set using the `useAuth` hook. For authenticated requests, seperate Axios instance, `useAxiosPrivate` is used to [intercept](https://axios-http.com/docs/interceptors) http requests and mutate them with the auth headers.
